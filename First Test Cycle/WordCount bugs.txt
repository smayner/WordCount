1) Program crashes if user enters "done" as first input.
2) Program displays "A division by zero has occurred" after every calculation.
3) Program exits immediately after processing a single file, making it impossible to read output.

Whitebox Concerns:
1) Program accepts un-sanitized input after the end, potential security vulnerability.

Enhancement Thoughts:
1) Change abbreviation requirement to a fixed list
2) Append is used unnecessarily, will fix
3) Program does not include ! as end of sentence punctuation; requirements problem.
