Hello and welcome to WordCount!

This readme document will walk you through using your WordCount program to best effect.

First and foremost, Python 3 or later must be installed on your system. You can find a download link https://www.python.org/downloads/ here. A default installation will suffice to use WordCount; make sure you download the right version of Python for your system.

In order to utilize WordCount, your essay must be a .txt document (that is, the same kind of file as this readme!) and in the same folder as your WordCount.py file. Do this by dragging the essay file into the place as you downloaded WordCount.py

Once you've done so, double click on the WordCount.py icon, and a window should open with a "Hello, welcome to WordCount!" prompt. Follow the instructions the program gives you.

While the program does display text output for specific users, it also outputs to a file called WordCount.txt, which will be created in the same folder as your WordCount.py program. Open that to see your results. Please note that this file will be overwritten every time WordCount is run! If you want to save a particular result, either rename
